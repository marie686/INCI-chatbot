Sunscreens are common supplements to clothing, particularly [[sunglasses]], [[sunhat]]s and special [[sun protective clothing]], and other forms of photoprotection (such as [[umbrella]]s).\\n\\nSunscreens may be classified according to the type of [[#Active_ingredients|active ingredient(s)]] present in the formulation ([[inorganic compound]]s or [[organic compound|organic molecules]]) as:\\n\\n* Mineral sunscreens (also referred to as physical), which use only [[inorganic compound]]s ([[zinc oxide]] and/or [[titanium dioxide]]) as active ingredients. These ingredients primarily work by absorbing UV rays but also through reflection and refraction.\\n* Chemical sunscreens, which use organic molecules as active ingredients. These products are sometimes referred to as petrochemical sunscreens since the active organic molecules are synthesized starting from building blocks typically derived from petroleum. Chemical sunscreen ingredients also mainly work by absorbing the UV rays. Over the years, some organic UV absorbers have been heavily scrutinised to assess their toxicity and a few of them have been banned in places such as Hawaii and Thailand for their impact on aquatic life and the environment.\\n* Hybrid sunscreens, which contain a combination of organic and inorganic UV filters.\\n\\nMedical organizations such as the [[American Cancer Society]] recommend the use of sunscreen because it aids in the prevention of [[squamous cell carcinomas]]. The routine use of sunscreens may also reduce the risk of [[melanoma]]. To effectively protect against all the potential damages of UV light, the use of broad-spectrum sunscreens (covering both [[Ultraviolet#Subtypes|UVA]] and [[Ultraviolet#Subtypes|UVB]] radiation) has been recommended.<ref name=\"fda2011\" />\\n\\nAs of 2021, only zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are generally recognized as safe and effective ([[Generally recognized as safe and effective|GRASE]]) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since there is currently insufficient data to support recognizing petrochemical UV filters as safe.'"

For example, [[ancient Greeks]] used olive oil for this purpose, and [[ancient Egypt]]ians used extracts of rice, jasmine, and lupine plants whose products are still used in skin care today. Zinc oxide paste has also been popular for skin protection for thousands of years. Among the nomadic sea-going [[Sama-Bajau people]] of the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]], a common type of sun protection is a paste called \\'\\'[[borak (cosmetic)|borak]]\\'\\' or \\'\\'[[borak (cosmetic)|burak]]\\'\\', which was made from water weeds, rice and spices. It is used most commonly by women to protect the face and exposed skin areas from the harsh tropical sun at sea. In [[Myanmar]], [[thanaka]], a yellow-white cosmetic paste made of ground bark, is traditionally used for sun protection. In [[Madagascar]], a ground wood paste called [[masonjoany]] has been worn for sun protection, as well as decoration and insect repellent, since the 18th century, and is ubiquitous in the Northwest coastal regions of the island to this day.\\n\\nThe first ultraviolet B filters were produced in 1928. Followed by the first sunscreen, invented in Australia by chemist H.A. Milton Blake, in 1932 formulating with the UV filter \\'salol\\' (Phenyl salicylate) at a concentration of 10%. Its protection was verified by the [[University of Adelaide]]. In 1936, [[L\\'Oreal]] released its first sunscreen product, formulated by French chemist [[Eugène Schueller]].<ref name=\"Lim_2004\" />\\n\\nThe US military was an early adopter of sunscreen. In 1944, as the hazards of sun overexposure became apparent to soldiers stationed in the Pacific tropics at the height of [[World War II]], Benjamin Green, an airman and later a [[pharmacist]] produced Red Vet Pet (for red veterinary petrolatum) for the US military. Sales boomed when [[Coppertone]] improved and commercialized the substance under the [[Coppertone girl]] and [[Bain de Soleil]] branding in the early 1950s. In 1946, [[Austria]]n chemist Franz Greiter introduced a product, called \\'\\'Gletscher Crème\\'\\' (Glacier Cream), subsequently became the basis for the company Piz Buin, named in honor of [[Piz Buin|the mountain]] where Greiter allegedly received the sunburn.\\n\\nIn 1974, Greiter adapted earlier calculations from Friedrich Ellinger and Rudolf Schulze and introduced the \"sun protection factor\" (SPF), which has become the global standard for measuring UVB protection. It has been estimated that \\'\\'Gletscher Crème\\'\\' had an SPF of 2.\\n\\nWater-resistant sunscreens were introduced in 1977, more appealing to use'"

      "In February 2019, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) started classifying already approved UV filter molecules into three categories: those which are [[generally recognized as safe and effective]] (GRASE), those which are non-GRASE due to safety issues, and those requiring further evaluation. As of 2021, only zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are recognized as GRASE. Two previously approved UV filters, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and trolamine salicylate, were banned in 2021 due to safety concerns. The remaining FDA approved active ingredients were put in the third category as their manufacturers have yet to produce sufficient safety data — despite the fact that some of the chemicals have sold in sunscreen products for more than 40 years. although environmentalists say this ignores \"ample safer alternatives available on the market containing the active ingredient minerals zinc oxide or titanium dioxide\", which are also safer for the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regulators can investigate and ban UV filters over safety concerns (such as [[Para-aminobenzoic acid|PABA]]), which can result in withdrawal of products from the consumer market. Regulators, such as the TGA and the FDA, have also been concerned with recent reports of contamination in sunscreen products with known possible human carcinogens such as [[benzene]] and [[benzophenone]]. Independent laboratory testing carried out by Valisure found benzene contamination in 27% of the sunscreens they tested, with some batches having up to triple the FDA's conditionally restricted limit of 2 parts per million (ppm). This resulted in a voluntary recall by some major sunscreen brands that were implicated in the testing, as such, regulators also help publicise and coordinate these voluntary recalls. VOC's (Volatile Organic Compounds) such as benzene, are particularly harmful in sunscreen formulations as many active and inactive ingredients can increase permeation across the skin. Butane, which is used as a propellant in spray sunscreens, has been found to have benzene impurities from the refinement process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent research by the FDA on six common petrochemical UV filters ([[avobenzone]], [[oxybenzone]], [[octocrylene]], [[homosalate]], [[2-Ethylhexyl salicylate|octisalate]], and [[octyl methoxycinnamate|octinoxate]]) found that they could be detected on the skin, in blood, in breast milk and in urine samples weeks after a single use.\n",

Coral reefs, comprising organisms in delicate ecological balances, are vulnerable to even minor environmental disturbances. Factors like temperature changes, invasive species, pollution, and detrimental fishing practices have previously been highlighted as threats to coral health.\n",

      "In 2018, Hawaii passed legislation that prohibits the sale of sunscreens containing [[oxybenzone]] and [[octinoxate]]. In sufficient concentrations, oxybenzone and octinoxate can damage coral DNA, induce deformities in coral [[Larva|larvae]], an assessment in Kahaluu Bay in Hawaii showed oxybenzone concentrations to be 262 times higher than what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designates as high-risk. Another study in Hanauma Bay found levels of the chemical ranging from 30 ng/L to 27,880 ng/L, noting that concentrations beyond 63 ng/L could induce toxicity in corals.\n",

      "Echoing Hawaii's initiative, other regions including Key West, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Bonaire, and Palau have also instituted bans on sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The environmental implications of sunscreen usage on marine ecosystems are multi-faceted and vary in severity. In a 2015 study, titanium dioxide nanoparticles, when introduced to water and subjected to ultraviolet light, were shown to amplify the production of hydrogen peroxide, a compound known to damage phytoplankton. In 2002, research indicated that sunscreens might escalate virus abundance in seawater, compromising the marine environment in a manner akin to other pollutants. Further probing the matter, a 2008 investigation examining a variety of sunscreen brands, protective factors, and concentrations revealed unanimous bleaching effects on hard corals. Alarmingly, the degree of bleaching magnified with increasing sunscreen quantities. When assessing individual compounds prevalent in sunscreens, substances such as butylparaben, ethylhexylmethoxycinnamate, benzophenone-3, and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor induced complete coral bleaching at even minimal concentrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 2020 study from the journal ''Current Dermatology Report'' summarized the situation as the US FDA currently approving only zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) as safe ultraviolet filters, and for those concerned with coral bleaching, they should use non-nano ZnO or TiO<sub>2</sub> since they have the most consistent safety data.\n",
